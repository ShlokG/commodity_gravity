CFS Preliminary Report: Shipment Characteristics by Mode of Transportation: 2017

Release Date : 12/06/2018

The data presented here are preliminary and will be superseded by the final release of the 2017 Commodity Flow Survey data tables scheduled for release in December 2019.
 Estimates are based on data from the 2017 Commodity Flow Survey. Estimates may not be additive due to rounding. For information on confidentiality protection, sampling error, nonsampling error, and definitions, see Survey Methodology.

Due to definitional and processing changes made each survey year, any data comparisons between one CFS survey and another should be made with caution. In 2017, multiple changes were implemented to the assignment of mode of transportation and mileage calculation. See the Survey Methodology for more details. 

To correct a processing error identified after the initial publication, data in this table differ slightly from the December 6, 2018 release.

Universe Description
The 2017 Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) covers business establishments with paid employees that are located in the United States and are classified using the 2012 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) in mining, manufacturing, wholesale trade, and selected retail trade and services industries, namely, electronic shopping and mail-order houses, fuel dealers, and publishers. Establishments classified in transportation, construction, and all other retail and services industries are excluded from the survey. Farms, fisheries, foreign establishments, and most government-owned establishments are also excluded. The survey also covers auxiliary establishments (i.e., warehouses and managing offices) of multi-establishments companies. 
 For the 2017 CFS, an advance survey (pre-canvass) of approximately 150,000 establishments was conducted to identify establishments with shipping activity and to try and obtain an accurate measure of their shipping activity. Surveyed establishments that indicated undertaking shipping activities and the non-respondents to the pre-canvass were included in the CFS sample universe.

[1] Wholesale establishments exclude manufacturers sales offices and own brand importers.
[2] Includes only captive warehouses that provide storage and shipping support to a single company. Warehouses offering their services to the general public and other businesses are excluded. For tabulation and publication purposes, NAICS 484 is grouped with NAICS 4931.
[3] For 2017 this industry includes NAICS 51223. In the 2012 cycle, NAICS 51223 was not sampled.
[4] Includes only those establishments in the industry with shipping activity as determined from the advance survey.
Excluded industries: Establishments classified in transportation (other than freight trucking and warehousing), construction and most retail and services industries are excluded. Foreign establishments are also excluded. Other industry areas that are not covered, but may have significant shipping activity, include agriculture and government. For agriculture, specifically, this means that the CFS does not cover shipments of agricultural products from the farm site to the processing centers or terminal elevators (most likely short-distance local movements), but does cover the shipments of these products from the initial processing centers or terminal elevators onward.
General exclusions: Data for government-operated establishments is excluded from the CFS. These include public utilities, publicly-operated bus and subway systems, public libraries, and government owned hospitals. The CFS also excludes establishments or firms with no paid employees and foreign establishments.
For more information, please see the North American Industry Classification System.
